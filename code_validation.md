# Code Validation

## Scope

This repository now treats the beam strength workflow in two separate buckets:

- Audited for implemented scope:
  - flexure
  - shear
  - optional torsion
- Still outside the present audit scope:
  - deflection

The audited scope is limited to:

- rectangular reinforced-concrete beam sections
- nonprestressed members
- normalweight concrete
- the ACI code families currently exposed by the app

| Torsion | Alternative procedure flag | ACI 318-19 `9.5.4.6` | Audited | Detection only; alternative procedure itself is not implemented |

## Remaining Review Items

The following items are intentionally still marked for engineering review:

1. Deflection logic is not yet reconstructed and remains outside the current audit.
2. Any member type outside the present scope, such as flanged sections, prestressed members, or special seismic detailing, remains outside this audit.

## Transparency Notes

- The audited scope above is clause-mapped in code comments and engine docstrings.
- Passing tests confirm the implemented formulas and current beam workflow remain internally consistent.
- This file does not expand the app scope beyond the items listed above.
